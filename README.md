Welcome to my Financial statements scraper project!

This is a Visual Basic project that enables the user to retrieve financial statements. This program is useful for creating a DCF or comparable analysis. 

Simply enter the ticker of a desired company and hit the GetData!-button.
The financial statements are generated, among with recent stock price and various company information.  

Enjoy!

All data is gathered from https://finance.yahoo.com/.
